============================================================
=== Deduplication Integration Test Suite ====================
============================================================

=== Part 1: Basic Bucket Deduplication ===

Testing: All same group (5 copies)
  Input: 5 groups
  Expected reps: 1
  Actual reps: 1 - PASS

Testing: All distinct (order 8)
  Input: 5 groups
  Expected reps: 5
  Actual reps: 5 - PASS

Testing: 3 isomorphism classes
  Input: 6 groups
  Expected reps: 3
  Actual reps: 3 - PASS

Testing: Single group
  Input: 1 groups
  Expected reps: 1
  Actual reps: 1 - PASS

Testing: Empty bucket - PASS

=== Part 2: Cross-Deduplication Simulation ===

Testing: New group not in S(n-1)
  S(n-1) size: 2
  S(n) size: 1
  Expected new: 1
  Actual new: 1 - PASS

Testing: Duplicate of S(n-1) group
  S(n-1) size: 1
  S(n) size: 1
  Expected new: 0
  Actual new: 0 - PASS

Testing: Mixed: some new, some duplicates
  S(n-1) size: 2
  S(n) size: 3
  Expected new: 1
  Actual new: 1 - PASS

Testing: All new
  S(n-1) size: 1
  S(n) size: 3
  Expected new: 3
  Actual new: 3 - PASS

=== Part 3: SigKey Consistency Test ===

Verifying that isomorphic groups have identical sigKeys...

  S4 vs S4: match expected - PASS
  S4 vs S4: match expected - PASS
  S4 vs SL(2,3): differ expected - PASS
  D8 vs D8: match expected - PASS

SigKey tests: 4 passed, 0 failed

=== Part 4: Invariant Filtering Test ===

Verifying that non-isomorphic groups can be distinguished by invariants...

  D8 vs Q8:
    Same fingerprint - need IsomorphismGroups
  C4 vs C2xC2:
    Distinguished by fingerprint - GOOD
      (differs in exponent)
      (differs in Frattini size)
  SmallGroup(24,3) vs SmallGroup(24,5):
    Distinguished by fingerprint - GOOD
      (differs in center size)
      (differs in derived size)
      (differs in conjugacy classes)

Invariant filtering: 2 pairs distinguished, 1 pairs need full comparison

=== Part 5: Order Profile Test ===

Testing order profile discrimination...

C4 x C2 order profile: rec(
  1 := 1,
  2 := 3,
  4 := 4 )
C8 order profile: rec(
  1 := 1,
  2 := 1,
  4 := 2,
  8 := 4 )
Distinguished by order profile - PASS
