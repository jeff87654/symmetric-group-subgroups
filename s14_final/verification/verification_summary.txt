A174511(14) = 7766  VERIFIED

Input: 75154 conjugacy class representatives of subgroups of S_14
Phase B invariants: TRUSTED (loaded from precomputed file)

=== Non-conjugacy (Phase C) ===
SKIPPED (SKIP_CONJUGACY = true)

=== Upper bound (at most 7766 types) ===
  64467 groups classified by IdGroup -> 4602 unique types
  10687 large groups linked by 7523 verified isomorphism proofs -> 3164 reps
  7523/
7523 proofs verified as bijective homomorphisms (injective + surjective)
  Total: 4602 + 3164 = 7766

=== Lower bound (at least 7766 types) ===
  4602 IdGroup types: distinct by IdGroup identifier
  3164 large group reps: pairwise non-isomorphic
