OEIS Submission Guide for A174511(14) = 7766
=============================================

This file describes how to submit the new term a(14) = 7766 to OEIS.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. Create an OEIS account at https://oeis.org/register if you don't have one
2. Wait for account approval (may take a few days)
3. Log in to https://oeis.org

STEP-BY-STEP SUBMISSION
------------------------

1. Go to: https://oeis.org/A174511

2. Click the "edit" link at the top of the sequence page

3. Update the DATA line to:
   1, 2, 4, 9, 16, 29, 55, 137, 241, 453, 894, 2065, 3845, 7766

4. Upload the new b-file:
   - Use the file: oeis/b174511.txt (included in this repository)
   - Upload via the b-file upload interface on the edit page

5. Add to the EXTENSIONS section:
   a(14) from _Jeffrey Yan_, Feb 08 2026

6. Optionally add a COMMENT:
   a(14) = 7766 was computed by enumerating all 75154 conjugacy classes of
   subgroups of S_14 (= A000638(14)), classifying 64467 groups via IdGroup
   (yielding 4602 types), and deduplicating the remaining 10687 large groups
   by isomorphism testing (yielding 3164 types). The result was independently
   verified through four rounds of checking using different algorithms.

7. Optionally add a LINK:
   Jeffrey Yan, <a href="https://github.com/jeff87654/symmetric-group-subgroups">Computation of A174511(14)</a>, GitHub, 2026.

8. In the Discussion box, write a message like:

   Computed a(14) = 7766 using GAP 4.15.1.

   Method: Computed all A000638(14) = 75,154 conjugacy class representatives
   of subgroups of S_14 via maximal subgroup decomposition. Classified each
   by abstract isomorphism type:
   - 64,467 groups with order < 2000 (excl. 512,768,1024,1536) -> 4,602
     unique IdGroup types
   - 10,687 large groups -> 3,164 unique types via invariant bucketing,
     direct product factor decomposition, ANUPQ 2-group testing, and
     pairwise IsomorphismGroups

   Verification: Result verified four times using independent methods:
   1. Original partition-based computation
   2. Double check: independent 6-way parallel recomputation
   3. Triple check: fresh start from A000638(14) conjugacy classes
   4. Quadruple check: independent DP algorithm (factor IdGroup
      canonicalization) + exhaustive verification of all isomorphism
      results (0 errors across 514 verification buckets)
